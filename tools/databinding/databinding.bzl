    """Configures rules for compiling android module that uses Databinding and Kotlin.

    The macro ensures that Kotlin code referenced in any XMLs are compiled first using kt_jvm_library
    and then uses android_library's enable_data_binding to generate required Databinding classes.

    This helps in breaking circular dependency when we have android_library (databinding enabled) -> kt_jvm_library.
    In that case, Databinding classes can't be generated until resources are processed and that
    happens only in android_library target. So compiling Koltin classes becomes dependent on
    android_library and android_library depends on kt_jvm_library since it needs class files to
    process class references in XML. This macro alleviates this problem by processing resources
    without `aapt` via a custom compiler and generates stub classes like
    R.java, BR.java and *Binding.java.

    Then Kotlin code can be safely compiled without errors. In the final stage, the stub classes
    are replaced with actual classes by android_library target.

    It also supports @BindingAdapters written in Kotlin.
